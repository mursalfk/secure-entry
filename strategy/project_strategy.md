# Project Strategy

## Define Requirements and Scope
Break down the project into smaller modules:
- **Facial Recognition**
- **Voice Recognition**
- **Access Control (Door Lock/Unlock)**
- **Alarm System**
- **Mobile App Integration**

Prioritize features (e.g., start with facial recognition, then add voice recognition).

## Set Up Development Environment
- Install Python for backend development.
- Set up **Dlib** for facial recognition (`pip install dlib`).
- Choose a voice recognition API (e.g., **Google Speech-to-Text**, **Microsoft Azure**, or Python libraries like **SpeechRecognition**).
- Decide on a mobile app framework (**React Native** or **Flutter**) and set up the environment.

## Develop Core Module
### Facial Recognition
- Use **Dlib** with a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., **ResNet** or **MMOD**) for face detection and recognition.
- Create a database (**SQLite**) to store facial data.

### Voice Recognition
- Implement voice capture and matching using a **voice recognition API** or library.
- Store voice samples securely.

### Access Control
- Simulate door unlocking (e.g., using a **relay module** or a **mock function**).
- Implement alarm logic (e.g., sound an alarm after **two failed attempts**).

## Integrate Modules
- Combine **facial** and **voice recognition** into a single authentication pipeline.
- Ensure the system triggers **alarms** and **notifications** based on authentication results.

## Develop Mobile App
Use **React Native** or **Flutter** to create a mobile app for:
- Managing facial and voice data (add/delete users).
- Sending notifications for access attempts.
- Integrate the app with the backend system.

## Test and Debug
- Test each module individually (**unit testing**).
- Perform **end-to-end testing** for the entire system.
- Debug and optimize performance.

## Deploy and Iterate
- Deploy the system on a **test setup** (e.g., a smart door prototype).
- Gather feedback and improve the system iteratively.

## Tools and Resources
### Facial Recognition:
- **Dlib**, **FaceNet**, or **MTCNN**

### Voice Recognition:
- **Google Speech-to-Text**, **Microsoft Azure**, or **Python SpeechRecognition**

### Mobile App:
- **React Native** or **Flutter**

### Database:
- **SQLite** or **Firebase** for cloud storage

### Hardware:
- **Raspberry Pi** or **Arduino** for prototyping

## Why Dlib?
- **Lightweight** and provides **high accuracy** for facial recognition.
- Supports **deep learning models** like **ResNet** for better performance.
- Easy to integrate with Python and works well for **real-time applications**.
